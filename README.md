## Explanation
1. Landing Page (React): Users land on the landing page where they can sign up or sign in using Azure AD B2C.<br/>
2. Azure AD B2C: Handles the authentication process by providing a secure sign-up/sign-in experience.<br/>
3. Spring Boot Backend: Handles REST API calls, manages the flow between the frontend and mongoDB, and communicates with Azure AI services.<br/>
4. MongoDB: Stores user data and other data inputs like survey data related to personality and productivity.<br/>
5. Azure AI Services: Analyzes collected data to calculate stress levels and provides recommendations such as break times, counseling, and other personalized interventions.<br/>
